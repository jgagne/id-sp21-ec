## Week 1

>
> —[Cameron Moll](http://cameronmoll.com), designer, writer, and speaker

> Real web designers write code. Always have, always will.

### Hello World

- [The World Wide Web project](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
- [This is a web page.](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html)
- [This is a motherfucking website.](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com)

### Homework

Working in HTML only, update your *naked* homepage via GitHub with some real content, maybe about what you’re interested in, what you like about the web, a few cool links, etc., using a handful of HTML elements, [sans CSS](https://laurakalbag.com/css-naked-day-2020/), and no [deprecated tag soup](https://css-tricks.com/why-do-some-html-elements-become-deprecated/).

#### Goals

1. Focus on content first.
2. How to define and separate content, semantics, and structure from visual presentation (look and feel, that’ll come later).
3. Overview of [HTML vocabulary](http://apps.workflower.fi/vocabs/html/en).
4. Overview of [HTML elements](http://html5doctor.com/#glossary).

#### Handoff

- Create a GitHub repo, with a `README.md` and an `index.html`, in all-lowercase, and separate words with a hyphen (no spaces or underscores).
  - For example:
    - `hello-world`
      - `index.html`
      - `README.md`
  - See [demo repo](https://github.com/ec-student/hello-world) for details.
  - See also [Naming guidelines](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames) and [Dashes vs. underscores](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/) for details.
- Add your URL to the `01-hello-world` channel in Slack.
